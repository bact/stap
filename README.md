# STAP: System Trustworthiness and Accountability Profile for ODRL

`This work is still under development.`

**stap**:
- Scottish: *one of the thin, narrow, shaped pieces of wood that form the sides of a cask*
- South Scots: *to push/force (something into something)*

STAP extends [Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)](https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/) using ODRL Profile Mechanism.
It is intended to provide additional Actions for Rules and additional Party Functions, among others, in the governance context of account-giving. 


## Sister projects

STA*V* (a *V*ocabulary) and STA*P* (an ODRL *P*rofile) are sisters for system trustworthiness and accountability.

- **STAV** provides a vocabulary extracted from regulations and policy documents, mostly AI safety-related. Its IRI is [https://w3id.org/stav](https://w3id.org/stav).
- **STAP** provides a set of core accountability relationships, based on [Open Digital Rights Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/). They are trying not to be AI-specific. Its IRI is [https://w3id.org/stap](https://w3id.org/stap).
